The CFO Helper project is a financial planning and scenario simulation tool designed for startup founders, event organizers, and small business owners who need quick answers to “what if” financial questions without advanced spreadsheet skills.

How to Execute the Project
Core Features:

Build a simple, interactive UI where users can adjust variables (spending, hiring, pricing) using sliders or input fields.

When a user changes values, the system instantly updates forecasts (budget left, runway duration, profits) using charts and plain-language summaries.

Allow users to export or share concise scenario reports that summarize outcomes.

Integrate a usage counter to visibly track how many scenarios have been simulated or reports exported (needed for pay-per-use billing).

Data & AI Integration:

Connect to mock or live financial data sources using real APIs or simulated streams. When new data arrives (fresh expenses, revenue, etc.), forecasts should update in real time.

Employ rule-based logic or ML models that map input changes to outcomes, ensuring explanations are understandable for non-experts.

Billing & Tracking:

Integrate a credit or billing system (e.g., pay per scenario tried, pay per report exported). Display current usage and balance prominently in the app.

Unique Features to Add
Collaboration Mode:

Enable multiple users (e.g., team members, accountants) to collaborate on scenario planning in real-time, making joint financial decisions more efficient.

AI-Powered Recommendations:

After each simulation, provide AI-driven suggestions (e.g., “Consider reducing marketing spend for greater runway” or “Hiring more staff will require revenue increase of X%”).

Scenario Templates:

Offer pre-built templates for common goals (e.g., product launch, cost cutbacks, fundraising planning). New users can quickly start with relevant scenarios.

Risk Sensitivity Analyzer:

Visualize financial risk by simulating multiple “stress test” variants (best case, worst case, probabilistic outcome bands) to help users prepare for uncertainty.

Integration with Accounting Platforms:

Seamlessly sync historical and current financials from popular accounting tools (e.g., QuickBooks, Zoho Books), reducing manual data entry.

Voice-Driven Inputs:

Allow users to say “What if I hire 2 more engineers?” or other natural language queries, automatically converting speech to actionable scenario changes.

Who Should Do This Project
People with experience in:

Frontend web/mobile development (interactive UI, charts)

Data engineering or backend expertise (API integration, billing systems)

Basic finance or accounting understanding (budgeting logic, forecasting)

AI/ML familiarity (suggestion engine, scenario evaluation)

This project stands out if it’s easy for non-experts, can handle live financial data, and delivers actionable business insights—especially with collaborative and AI-enhanced planning features.
